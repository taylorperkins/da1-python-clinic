# da1-python-clinic
Medical center for the pythonic brain

## Goal: 
Go over tough topics!!
We will be covering different python topics every saturday. 
This repository will keep the history of that process, and the code that we went over. 

```
/data  # hidden in .gitignore
  --> data files
/notebooks
  /<date>
    --> notebooks
```

There is a .env file at the top of this repository.. 
It is _encouraged_ to `pip install dotenv-python` so that you can make use of its abilities!
